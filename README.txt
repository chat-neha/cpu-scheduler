We have implemented a file manager system, on which you can carry out file functions like open, create, close and delete. 

Every function carried out by the user corresponds to a job that is scheduled in the background by a job scheduler. Algorithms thta have been covered are:
1. First Come First Serve
2. Shortest Job First
3. Round Robin
4. Priority scheduling 

Data structures that have been used are (from Java Collections framework):
1. List/ ArrayList
2. Queue
3. Stack

For the file-manager, we have implemented a custom tree data structure.
